We can do sampling to handle the imbalanced data and see the results of the classfiers vs results of classifiers with imbalanced data.
Used the original data downloaded from the kaggle directly using transaction, members, user_logs files.
Uploading the table_data_analysis_.ipnyb file , added some visualisations, changed the format of the columns etc. - also can refer our drive created.
What to do next : show the churned data table, Need to merge tables and then work on the sampling to handle imbalance.
